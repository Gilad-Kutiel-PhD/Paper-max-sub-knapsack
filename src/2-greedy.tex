We consider the algorithm that chooses the best solution between the greedysolution and the best of all pairs.We assume w.l.o.g. that $f(O) = 1$, where $O$ is an optimal set.Let $\varepsilon > 0$ a constant to be determined latter on, and let $S$ be the output of the above algorithm.\begin{theorem}$f(S) \geq 1 - e^{-(1/2 + \varepsilon)}$
\end{theorem}\begin{proof}
Fix an optimal solution $O$, and let $A$ be the set of elements chosen by the greedy algorithm until the first element from the optimal solution, $x$, was dropped. If $f(A) \geq 1 - e^{-(1/2 + \varepsilon)}$ we are done, otherwise define $f(A) = 1 - e^-{1/2 + \varepsilon - \delta}$. This implies that the cost of $A$ is at most $1/2 + \varepsilon - \delta$, and, thus, the cost of $x$ is at least $1/2 - \varepsilon + \delta$.Call an element \emph{heavy} if it costs at least $1/4 + \varepsilon/2 - \delta/2$(otherwise call it \emph{light}), and observe that there are at most 2 heavy elements in the optimal solution.If the value of the heavy elements of the optimal solution is at least $1-e^{-(1/2 + \varepsilon)}$ we are done again. Otherwise, the value of the light elements in the optimal solution is at least $e^{-(1/2 + \varepsilon)}$.Also the total cost of the light elements in the optimal solution is at most $1/2 + \varepsilon - \delta$.Thus, the total value obtained by the algorithm is at least the minimum between:$$\min_\delta1-e^{-(1/2 + \varepsilon - \delta)}+\left[e^{-(1/2 + \varepsilon)}-(1-e^{-(1/2 + \varepsilon - \delta)})\right](1-e^{-\frac{1-6\varepsilon + 6\delta}{2 + 4\varepsilon - 4\delta}})$$ and$$1-e^{-(1/2 + \varepsilon)}$$Defining $\varepsilon = 1.04$ completes the proof. \end{proof}
