In the \emph{Budgeted Maximum Cover} problem we are given a ground set of elements 
$X = \{x_1, \dots, x_n\}$ and a collection of subsets over $X$, 
$\mathcal{S} = \{S_1, \dots, S_m\}$.
A cost function, $c:\mathcal{S} \to \mathbb{R}_+$ assigns cost to each set 
and a weight function $w:X \to \mathbb{R}_+$ assigns weight to each element. 
The goal is to find a collection of sets $\mathcal{S'} \subseteq \mathcal{S}$ such that the 
total cost of the sets in the collection does not exceed a given budget, $B$, and the 
total weight of the elements covered by $\mathcal{S'}$ is maximal.
