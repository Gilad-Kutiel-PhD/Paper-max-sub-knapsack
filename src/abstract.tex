A well known result by Khuller et. al states that the \emph{Budgeted Maximum
Cover} can be approximated within a factor of $1-e^{-1}$ and this is the best one can hope for unless 
P = NP.
This result was generalized by Sviridenko to a general monotone submodular function maximization
under knapsack constraint. 
This algorithm requires $O(n^5)$ calls to the value oracle.
A faster algorithm was presented by Khuller et. al for the Budgeted Maximum Cover.  
This algorithm runs in time $O(n^2)$ and its approximation ratio is at least $1-e^{-1/2}$.
Krause and Guestrin extend the analysis of this algorithm
for a general monotone submodular function maximization. 
The analysis of this algorithm, however, has a logical flaw 
(in the above and other papers as well). 
In this paper we fix this flaw and show that indeed the approximation ratio of this
algorithm is at least $1-e^{-1/2}$. 
We also consider a modification of this algorithm with 
the same running time and give a better lower bound for its approximation ratio.
