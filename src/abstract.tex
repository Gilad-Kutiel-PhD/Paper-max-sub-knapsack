A well known result by Khuller et. al state that the \emph{Budgeted Maximum Cover}
can be approximated within a factor of $1-e^{-1}$ and this is the best one can hope for unless 
P = NP.
This result was generalized by Sviridenko to a general monotone submodular function maximization
under knapsack constraint. 
This algorithm requires $O(n^5)$ calls to the value oracle.
A faster algorithm, presented by Khuller et. al for the Budgeted Maximum Cover and later 
generalized by Krause and Guestrin for a general monotone submodular function, 
requires only $O(n^2)$ calls to the value oracle that 
achieves a $1-e^{-1/2}$ approximation ratio is known.
The analysis of this algorithm, however, has a logical flaw 
(in the above and other papers as well). 
In this paper we fix this flaw and show that indeed this algorithm achieves a $1-e^{-1/2}$ 
approximation ratio, we also consider a modification of this algorithm with 
the same running time and show that it achieves a better approximation ratio.
